  description: "This thesis presents a novel robot placement algorithm DeCOWA (Determining Commutation configuration using Optimization and Workspace Analysis) for domestic mobile manipulators. It computes a favorable position and orientation of the mobile base enabling a high chance of successful planning to target through a short path, while accounting for sensing and actuation errors typical in real world scenarios.

  description: "Autonomous  vehicles  and  driver  assistance  systems  utilize  maps  of  3D  semantic  landmarks  for  improved decision  making.  However,  scaling  the  mapping  process  aswell  as  regularly  updating  such  maps  come  with  a  huge  cost. Crowdsourced mapping of these landmarks such as traffic signpositions  provides  an  appealing  alternative.  The  state-of-the-art  approaches  to  crowdsourced  mapping  use  ground  truthcamera  parameters,  which  may  not  always  be  known  or  maychange  over  time.  In  this  work,  we  demonstrate  an  approachto  computing  3D  traffic  sign  positions  without  knowing  thecamera focal lengths, principal point, and distortion coefficientsa priori. We validate our proposed approach on a public datasetof traffic signs in KITTI. Using only a monocular color cameraand  GPS,  we  achieve  an  average  single  journey  relative  andabsolute positioning accuracy of 0.26 m and 1.38 m, respectively. "

  description: "The ability to efficiently utilize crowdsourced visual data carries immense potential for the domains of large scale dynamic mapping and autonomous driving. However, state-of-the-art methods for crowdsourced 3D mapping assume prior knowledge of camera intrinsics. In this work, we propose a framework that estimates the 3D positions of semantically meaningful landmarks such as traffic signs without assuming known camera intrinsics, using only monocular color camera and GPS. We utilize multi-view geometry as well as deep learning based self-calibration, depth, and ego-motion estimation for traffic sign positioning, and show that combining their strengths is important for increasing the map coverage. To facilitate research on this task, we construct and make available a KITTI based 3D traffic sign ground truth positioning dataset. Using our proposed framework, we achieve an average single-journey relative and absolute positioning accuracy of 39cm and 1.26m respectively, on this dataset. "
