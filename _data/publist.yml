  image: g2s.png
  description: "Dense depth estimation is essential to scene-understanding for autonomous driving. However, recent self-supervised approaches on monocular videos suffer from scale-inconsistency across long sequences. Utilizing data from the ubiquitously copresent global positioning systems (GPS), we tackle this challenge by proposing a dynamically-weighted GPS-to-Scale (g2s) loss to complement the appearance-based losses. We emphasize that the GPS is needed only during the multimodal training, and not at inference. The relative distance between frames captured through the GPS provides a scale signal that is independent of the camera setup and scene distribution, resulting in richer learned feature representations. Through extensive evaluation on multiple datasets, we demonstrate scale-consistent and -aware depth estimation during inference, improving the performance even when training with low-frequency GPS data."

- title: "Practical Auto-Calibration for Spatial Scene-Understanding from Crowdsourced Dashcamera Videos"
  image: Autocalib.png
  description: "Spatial scene-understanding, including dense depth and ego-motion estimation, is an important problem in computer vision for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. Thus, it is beneficial to design perception modules that can utilize crowdsourced videos collected from arbitrary vehicular onboard or dashboard cameras. However, the intrinsic parameters corresponding to such cameras are often unknown or change over time. Typical manual calibration approaches require objects such as a chessboard or additional scene-specific information. On the other hand, automatic camera calibration does not have such requirements. Yet, the automatic calibration of dashboard cameras is challenging as forward and planar navigation results in critical motion sequences with reconstruction ambiguities. Structure reconstruction of complete visual-sequences that may contain tens of thousands of images is also computationally untenable. Here, we propose a system for practical monocular onboard camera auto-calibration from crowdsourced videos. We show the effectiveness of our proposed system on the KITTI raw, Oxford RobotCar, and the crowdsourced D2-City datasets in varying conditions. Finally, we demonstrate its application for accurate monocular dense depth and ego-motion estimation on uncalibrated videos.  "

  image: 3D_positioning.png
  description: "The ability to efficiently utilize crowdsourced visual data carries immense potential for the domains of large scale dynamic mapping and autonomous driving. However, state-of-the-art methods for crowdsourced 3D mapping assume prior knowledge of camera intrinsics. In this work, we propose a framework that estimates the 3D positions of semantically meaningful landmarks such as traffic signs without assuming known camera intrinsics, using only monocular color camera and GPS. We utilize multi-view geometry as well as deep learning based self-calibration, depth, and ego-motion estimation for traffic sign positioning, and show that combining their strengths is important for increasing the map coverage. To facilitate research on this task, we construct and make available a KITTI based 3D traffic sign ground truth positioning dataset. Using our proposed framework, we achieve an average single-journey relative and absolute positioning accuracy of 39cm and 1.26m respectively, on this dataset. "

  description: "Autonomous  vehicles  and  driver  assistance  systems  utilize  maps  of  3D  semantic  landmarks  for  improved decision  making.  However,  scaling  the  mapping  process  aswell  as  regularly  updating  such  maps  come  with  a  huge  cost. Crowdsourced mapping of these landmarks such as traffic signpositions  provides  an  appealing  alternative.  The  state-of-the-art  approaches  to  crowdsourced  mapping  use  ground  truthcamera  parameters,  which  may  not  always  be  known  or  maychange  over  time.  In  this  work,  we  demonstrate  an  approachto  computing  3D  traffic  sign  positions  without  knowing  thecamera focal lengths, principal point, and distortion coefficientsa priori. We validate our proposed approach on a public datasetof traffic signs in KITTI. Using only a monocular color cameraand  GPS,  we  achieve  an  average  single  journey  relative  andabsolute positioning accuracy of 0.26 m and 1.38 m, respectively. "
