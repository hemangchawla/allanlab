Namaste, I am Hemang Chawla. I am a Computer Vision Research Engineer at the [Advanced Research Lab, Navinfo Europe](https://www.navinfo.eu/artificial-intelligence.html). My research interests focus on the synergistic integration of 3D geometry with deep learning.  Within the AI Research lab, I have worked on semantic SLAM, 3D vision, and crowdsourced mapping. 

Prior to joining NavInfo, I worked on problems in path planning, control, and SLAM for healthcare and cleaning service robot startups. I have a postgraduate in [Robotics](https://tudelftroboticsinstitute.nl/) from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/), where I worked on mobile manipulation under [Dr. Martijn Wisse](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=ddu5MKwAAAAJ). During my bachelors from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Bijay Rout](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=BH13o4YAAAAJ) at the [Center for Robotics and Intelligent Systems](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/centreforrobotics/Home).
